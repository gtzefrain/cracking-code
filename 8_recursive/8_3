A magic index in an array A [ 0 ••• n -1] 
is defined to be an index such that A[ i] = i.

Given a sorted array of distinct integers, 
write a method to find a magic index, 
if one exists, in array A.

magic = [-2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10]

BRUTE FORCE FIRST

find(int[] array){
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        if (array[i] == i) {
            return i
        }
    }
}

complexity: O(n)


OPTIMIZE 

can use a search algorithm, as it is already sorted options are:
    binary search
    jump search

Binary Search is better than Jump Search
but Jump Search has the advantage that we traverse back only once 
(Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, 
consider a situation where the element to be searched is the 
smallest element or just bigger than the smallest). 
So, in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search.
